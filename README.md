# programming

`programming` is very much a work-in-progress repo for a bunch of basic tasks in several useful languages. Useful meaning, useful to me. 

Languages include:

- [x] bash/shell
- [ ] make (makefile)
- [ ] python
- [ ] ruby
- [ ] julia
- [ ] CSS
- [ ] java
- [ ] HTML
- [ ] others...

The goal is to create a sandbox for trying out new things and creating templates for future tasks and projects. [PRs](https://github.com/pdwaggoner/programming/pulls) and [issues](https://github.com/pdwaggoner/programming/issues) are always welcomed, if anyone would care to share basic knowledge of these widely used languages for common, open source benefit.
