# programming

`programming` is very much a work-in-progress repo for a bunch of basic tasks in several useful languages. Useful meaning, useful to me. 

Languages include:

* make (makefile)
* bash/shell
* python
* ruby
* julia
* CSS
* java
* HTML
* others...

The goal is to create a sandbox for trying out new things and creating templates for future tasks and projects. PRs and issues are always welcomed, if anyone would care to share basic knowledge of these widely used languages for common, open source benefit.
